%start a new page for the table of contents.  Put the footnote here for the references for the questions.
\newpage\tableofcontents\footnote{This list of questions was compiled over time beginning in 1992, and the list includes many questions that I wrote, but some of the questions have come from or been inspired by other authors.  Unfortunately, I did not realize when I began this list over a decade ago that I would be publishing it on the web, and I apologize for any references that are missing.  } 


%I'm not sure what this is but I'm going to try this just for fun.
