**Writing to Learn Mathematics**

A repository of writing prompts for a variety of college mathematics courses.

# Calculus Writing Prompts

## What are these writing assignments?  

I have used these writing prompts in Calculus I, II and III for a couple of decades.  In order to have an extensive list of writing prompts for the Calc sequence at my fingertips I gathered up writing prompts I had written, collected more from various textbooks, and wrote more to fill out the list.  This list of more than 600 writing prompts are not tied to any given text and could be used to supplement any calculus course.  

## Who might use these lists?  

This list of writing assignments might be helpful to any instructor who wants to use writing in a calculus course.  If you want to use writing for the first time, then you will find questions in these lists to help you get started.  On the other hand, if you are a veteran user of writing in calculus and are looking for some new questions or ways to ask about the same concept in a different way, then this list is also for you. 
  
I have found the writing resources more plentiful for Calculus I than for Calculus III and so I have made a point of trying to include questions on the calculus of functions of 2 variables and parametric curves.
  
Some of the questions require only a short response and others are more involved.  Of course, the length of the response may depend on the implicit and explicit requirements from the instructor.  Some of these questions could be used for longer writing assignments (short papers) while others are short enough to be appropriate for one-minute papers at the end of class.

## What are the learning goals for writing in my calculus class?  

I want the students to make connections between the analytical, numerical, graphical and verbal representations of mathematics.  The underlying assumption of the writing is that the students will incorporate a variety of representations of mathematics in the essays.  
  
I also want to help the students understand the definitions, concepts and processes.  Thus, many of the questions require the students to explain a process, to develop examples, or to address common misconceptions.   I strongly believe that students remember the concepts better and longer when they have had to work with the concept both algorithmically and verbally.
  
To help students create connections between various concepts for themselves I have included concept map questions.  In these questions, the students will be given a list of concepts (like differentiability, continuity and integrability) and are asked to create a map that shows the interrelationships of these concepts.  While the results of these questions are more an annotated diagram than paragraphs, they are powerful tools for helping the student construct their own mental images of the structure of mathematics.
  
Another way to help students make connections between concepts is to ask them to compare and contrast a technique or concept they recently learned with a technique or concept from the past.  I believe that students retain material longer when they can place that material within the context of previously understood concepts.  This also strengthens the understanding of the older concepts.
  
It is well established that we learn a lot about how the students are learning and how we are teaching when we have students write in class.  So another purpose of this writing is to provide me with a formative assessment of both the learning and teaching on an ongoing basis throughout the semester.
  
Some of the assignments ask the students to reflect on what they know and what they need to work on.  The students will complete these writing assignments a couple of days before an exam to help them prepare their own review for the exam.  I hope that by modeling this type of self-assessment for the students they will in turn develop their own strong self-assessment tools for future courses.
  
Sometimes I ask the students to determine if a statement is valid.  Some questions ask for a computation but it is assumed that the student will write the results of that computation in paragraph form.  The students are asked to develop test questions given an equation or other data.  I often ask them to complete a dimensional analysis of a formula involving a derivative or integral.  All of these questions are intended to help the students review the material or to build on their understanding of the concepts and to help them practice the art of writing mathematics.
  
## How do we help prepare our students for mathematical writing?  

Although our students are being required to do more writing in mathematics courses in high school, we still need to help them understand what is required of collegiate writing.  It is important to expect our students to write using correct grammar, spelling, and with a good style.  The writing should be easy to read by someone with the appropriate mathematical background.  The format of the writing should also be appropriate for mathematics and the students should understand that writing varies across the disciplines.  Above all, the mathematical content of the writing must be correct.
  
You may or may not agree with this philosophy, but regardless of the standards you would expect of the writing, these standards need to be explicitly and clearly explained to the students and it takes more than just providing a checklist of the writing requirements for the students to fully understand what it takes to write well in mathematics.  
  
I help the students build an understanding of what I think makes good mathematical writing in several ways.  Of course, I give them feedback on the writing itself but I also find good and bad examples of the writing in the assignments and print these up for the students to see.  Only on the good examples do I provide the author's name.  I hope these examples help the students understand the concepts in addition to modeling good and bad writing.  Students have commented on the end-of-year evaluations that seeing their name on a good example helped build their confidence for doing mathematics.  For this reason, I try to find a good example to use from as many students in the class, but especially from those students who struggle or have low self-esteem.
  
On the day before an exam, I give essays to groups of 2 or 3 students to complete on the chalkboard.  Each group gets a different essay.  After they are done, I go around the room and talk about the results and give each essay a grade out of 10 points as if it had been written for an exam.  This provides a review of the concepts and helps the students understand how I assign scores to writing on the exam.  This also helps alleviate some of the apprehensions they have about taking the exam.
  
Having the students complete this much writing (in addition to homework and exams) adds to the workload for the instructor.  If you want to use this method for having the students write, you need to have an efficient method for collecting, marking, recording, and returning the assignments.  But there are other ways to have the students do writing in class without having to grade 40 essays every week.  
  
* You could have the students answer a question a week in a journal and collect a couple of journals from different students at irregular times during the semester to provide feedback.  
* Use some of the questions as writing prompts for one-minute papers.  
* Peer review of the essays can be very effective and can be done outside of class.  
* The students can respond to essay questions by typing up the results with LaTeX and submit a PDF them through your LMS.  Most LMSs have a way to create inline comments and annotations directly in the PDF to return to the students. Some faculty find this way of grading relatively quick and it helps the students practice mathematical typesetting.  
* Be creative and fit the writing into your own classroom style.

### How to build your own set of writing assignments. 

When you teach a course, get the annotated teacher's edition of the text and read through the supplemental information provided by the author for the instructor.  Many times the author will make suggestions about pedagogy that lend themselves to good writing assignments.  Read through other texts besides the one you are using and look for margin notes.  These are usually warnings and further explanations for the students that can be rewritten as a writing prompt.  Pay attention to those issues that come up on the homework and the exam. 

If  students struggle with a specific issue, then ask them to write about it.  I ask questions like, "A friend of yours had $\sqrt{9 + 4} = 3 + 2 = 5$  on their paper.  Gently explain what is wrong with this statement and give your friend some pointers for avoiding this mistake in the future."  If you students are using the wrong integration method it is an opportunity to ask them to compare the evaluation of 2 different but similar integrals and to write about it as in, "Compare and contrast the evaluation of the integrals $\int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\ dx$ and $\int\frac{1}{1 + x}\ dx$ ." (I apologize for not going through the tricks to get SunDown to render LaTeX code.)
  
### Sharing is good.  

Feel free to use any of these questions in your class (but keep in mind the original sources of some of the questions).  I realize that the language I wrote with might not suit you, so feel free to rewrite, shorten, lengthen or in any other way adjust my questions to fit your needs.  If you find this web site useful or have other comments, please drop me an e-mail at murphy.waggoner@simpson.edu.  Of course, if you have interesting questions to share, please let me know that, too.  I am always on the lookout for new questions or new ways to ask about the same concepts.

Please, forgive the multitude of typographical errors that I am sure exist in these documents and share with me (gently) the ones you see.
  
### Other keywords

When I was looking for writing prompts on the web (hoping not to reinvent the wheel) I did a search on "writing" and "calculus" and other terms.  I didn't find a whole lot.  I'm hoping that when someone else does a search, they find this site (and find it useful).  So here are some other keywords that someone might search for:  calculus writing, calculus essays, writing prompts for calculus, journal entry prompts for calculus, and writing to learn calculus.
